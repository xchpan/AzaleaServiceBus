AzaleaServiceBus
================

A simple service bus using microsoft.net.

The first step is to enable the data provider and consumer fully decoupled, without knowing each other at all. This release
requires the data need to be serialized into xml, and use xpath as filter for client to subscribe and to filter out the
data.
